**When to use character poses during dialogue events.** 

For Copilot (These are new instructions to add if not already added) 

You can determine by the dialogue how a character's tone is.   
Character poses can be located in **assets/images/characters**  
In the characters folder there will be **/poses**

This will have character poses typically used for dialogue events.   
Poses are png images.   
All poses images will always be named charactername-emotion.png ex: **synthya-happy.png**  
Non emotion or during regular dialogue should always use the **speak.png  ex: synthya-speak.png**

Always stop and ask questions if unable to decide what pose to use during dialogue, do not proceed.
